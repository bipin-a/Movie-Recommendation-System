A cloud native ML movie recommendation system through PySpark, which bases predictions on a user's input of their favourite movies. Currently ongoing edits. 

Currently a user is able to input their favoruite movies and an Alternating Least Square algorithm. The accuracy still needs to be improved. 

Next Steps: 
1. Using a larger dataset.
2. Train using different supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
